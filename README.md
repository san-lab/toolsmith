Various little tools to work with blockchain

Any tool that is helpful, is helpful.
Having said that, let us agree on some principles:
1) Single technology: if itÂ´s go, it,s go, if node - node,etc. Do not combine, we do not want to be forced to diagnose our diagnostic tools
2) No dependencies (minimal dependencies). A simple tool should not require half of the Internet to compile
3) Trivial install
4) Modular
